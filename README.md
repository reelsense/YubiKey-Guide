This is a guide to using [YubiKey](https://www.yubico.com/faq/yubikey/) as a [SmartCard](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/38924/how-does-storing-gpg-ssh-private-keys-on-smart-cards-compare-to-plain-usb-drives) for storing GPG encryption, signing and authentication keys, which can be used for SSH.

Keys stored on YubiKey are non-exportable (as opposed to file-based keys that are stored on disk) and are convenient for everyday use. Instead of having to remember and enter passphrases to unlock SSH/GPG keys, YubiKey needs only a physical touch after being unlocked with a PIN code. All signing and encryption operations happen on the card, rather than in OS memory.

**New!** [Purse](https://github.com/drduh/Purse) is a password manager which can integrate with GPG on YubiKey.

If you have a comment or suggestion, please open an [issue](https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide/issues) on GitHub.

# Purchase YubiKey

YubiKey 4 has support for **4096 bit** RSA keys in OTP+CCID mode, whereas NEO are [limited](https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/compare-yubikeys/) to **2048 bit** RSA keys.

Consider purchasing a pair of keys and programming both in case of loss or damage to one of them.

# Live image

It is recommended to generate cryptographic keys and configure YubiKey from a secure environment. One way to do is by downloading and booting to a [Debian Live](https://www.debian.org/CD/live/) or [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/index.en.html) image loaded from a USB drive into memory.

Download the latest image and verify its integrity:

```
$ curl -LfO https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-xfce.iso

$ curl -LfO https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current-live/amd64/iso-hybrid/SHA512SUMS

$ !!.sign

$ gpg --verify SHA512SUMS.sign SHA512SUMS
[...]
gpg: Good signature from "Debian CD signing key <debian-cd@lists.debian.org>" [unknown]
[...]

$ grep $(sha512sum debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-xfce.iso) SHA512SUMS
d2b0fe266ef809943f24b71f6a7c1c7a1645a2ee0b51e71bb05625ca84f16904a8889287d580fcb5d8ff1152785f90ffdb1621733bbb148431155478b0006114  debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-xfce.iso
```

Mount a USB drive and copy the image over to it:

```
$ sudo dd if=debian-live-9.5.0-amd64-xfce.iso of=/dev/sdc bs=4M

$ sync
```

Shut down the computer and disconnect hard drives and any unnecessary peripherals.

Plug in the USB drive and boot to the live image. Configure networking to continue.

# Required software

```
$ sudo apt-get update

$ sudo apt-get install -y \
     curl gnupg2 gnupg-agent \
     cryptsetup scdaemon pcscd \
     yubikey-personalization
```

You may also need more recent versions of [yubikey-personalization](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-personalization/Releases/) and [yubico-c](https://developers.yubico.com/yubico-c/Releases/).

**macOS** Download and install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and the following Brew packages - `gnupg yubikey-personalization hopenpgp-tools ykman pinentry-mac`

**Windows** Download and install [Gpg4Win](https://www.gpg4win.org/) and [PuTTY](https://putty.org).

## Entropy

Generating keys will require a lot of randomness. To check the available bits of entropy available on Linux:

```
$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
849
```

A hardware random number generator like [OneRNG](http://onerng.info/onerng/) will increase the speed of entropy generation and possibly its quality. To install and configure OneRNG:

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y rng-tools at python-gnupg openssl

$ curl -LfO https://github.com/OneRNG/onerng.github.io/raw/master/sw/onerng_3.6-1_all.deb

$ sha256sum onerng_3.6-1_all.deb
a9ccf7b04ee317dbfc91518542301e2d60ebe205d38e80563f29aac7cd845ccb

$ sudo dpkg -i onerng_3.6-1_all.deb

$ echo "HRNGDEVICE=/dev/ttyACM0" | sudo tee /etc/default/rng-tools

$ sudo service rng-tools restart
```

If the service fails to start, kick off `atd` and try again:

```
$ sudo atd ; sudo service rng-tools restart
```

Plug in the OneRNG and empty `/dev/random` - the light on the device should dim briefly. Verify the available entropy pool is re-seeded.

```
$ cat /dev/random >/dev/null
[Control-C]

$ cat /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail
3049
```

# Creating keys

Create a tempotary directory which won't survive a [reboot](https://serverfault.com/questions/377348/when-does-tmp-get-cleared):

```
$ export GNUPGHOME=$(mktemp -d) ; echo $GNUPGHOME
/tmp/tmp.aaiTTovYgo
```

Create a hardened configuration for GPG with the following options or by downloading my [recommended](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf) version directly:

```
$ curl -Lfo $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf

$ cat $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES CAST5

no-comments
no-emit-version
keyid-format 0xlong
list-options show-uid-validity

use-agent
```

Disable networking for the remainder of the setup.


# Master key

The first key to generate is the master key. It will be used for certification only - to issue sub-keys that are used for encryption, signing and authentication. This master key should be kept offline at all times.

You'll be prompted to enter and verify a passphrase - keep it handy as you'll need it throughout. To generate a strong passphrase which could be written down in a hidden or secure place; or memorized:

```
$ gpg --gen-random -a 0 24
ydOmByxmDe63u7gqx2XI9eDgpvJwibNH
```

Generate a new key with GPG, selecting `(4) RSA (sign only)` and `4096` bit keysize - do not set the key to expire (see Note #3).

```
$ gpg --full-generate-key

Please select what kind of key you want:
   (1) RSA and RSA (default)
   (2) DSA and Elgamal
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
Your selection? 4
RSA keys may be between 1024 and 4096 bits long.
What keysize do you want? (2048) 4096
Requested keysize is 4096 bits
Please specify how long the key should be valid.
         0 = key does not expire
      <n>  = key expires in n days
      <n>w = key expires in n weeks
      <n>m = key expires in n months
      <n>y = key expires in n years
Key is valid for? (0) 0
Key does not expire at all
Is this correct? (y/N) y

GnuPG needs to construct a user ID to identify your key.

Real name: Dr Duh
Email address: doc@duh.to
Comment:
You selected this USER-ID:
    "Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>"

Change (N)ame, (C)omment, (E)mail or (O)kay/(Q)uit? o

We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
gpg: /tmp.FLZC0xcM/trustdb.gpg: trustdb created

public and secret key created and signed.

Note that this key cannot be used for encryption.  You may want to use
the command "--edit-key" to generate a subkey for this purpose.
pub   rsa4096/0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB 2017-10-09 [SC]

uid                              Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>
```

Note that as of GPG [version 2.1](https://www.gnupg.org/faq/whats-new-in-2.1.html#autorev) a revocation certificate is automatically generated.

Export the key ID as a [variable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1158091/defining-a-variable-with-or-without-export/1158231#1158231) for use later:

```
$ export KEYID=0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB
```

# Sub-keys

Edit the Master key to add sub-keys:

```
$ gpg --expert --edit-key $KEYID

Secret key is available.

sec  rsa4096/0xEA5DE91459B80592

```

Use 4096-bit keysize on YubiKey 4 and 2048-bit on NEO.

Use a 1 year expiration - it can always be renewed using the previous offline Master key.

## Signing

Create a [signing key](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5421107/can-rsa-be-both-used-as-encryption-and-signature/5432623#5432623) by selecting `(4) RSA (sign only)`:

```
gpg> addkey

## Encryption

Next, create an [encryption key](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs5430/2015sp/notes/rsa_sign_vs_dec.php) by selecting `(6) RSA (encrypt only)`:

```
gpg> addkey

## Authentication

Finally, create an [authentication key](https://superuser.com/questions/390265/what-is-a-gpg-with-authenticate-capability-used-for).

GPG doesn't provide an authenticate-only key type, so select `(8) RSA (set your own capabilities)` and toggle the required capabilities until the only allowed action is `Authenticate`:

```
gpg> addkey
Please select what kind of key you want:
   (3) DSA (sign only)
   (4) RSA (sign only)
   (5) Elgamal (encrypt only)
   (6) RSA (encrypt only)

To verify with OpenPGP key checks, use the automated [key best practice checker](https://riseup.net/en/security/message-security/openpgp/best-practices#openpgp-key-checks):

```
$ sudo apt-get install hopenpgp-tools
$ gpg --export $KEYID | hokey lint
```

The output will display any problems with your key in red text. If everything is green, your key passes each of the tests. If it is red, your key has failed one of the tests.

> hokey may warn (orange text) about cross certification for the authentication key. GPG's [Signing Subkey Cross-Certification](https://gnupg.org/faq/subkey-cross-certify.html) documentation has more detail on cross certification, and gpg v2.2.1 notes "subkey <keyid> does not sign and so does not need to be cross-certified".

# Export keys

The Master and sub-keys will be encrypted with your passphrase when exported.

Save a copy of your keys:

```
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/mastersub.key

$ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID > $GNUPGHOME/sub.key
```

On Windows, note that using any extension other than `.gpg` or attempting IO redirection to a file will garble the secret key, making it impossible to import it again at a later date:

```
$ gpg --armor --export-secret-keys $KEYID -o \path\to\dir\mastersub.gpg

$ gpg --armor --export-secret-subkeys $KEYID -o \path\to\dir\sub.gpg
```

# Backup keys

Once keys are moved to hardware, they cannot be extracted again, so make sure you have made an **encrypted** backup before proceeding. An encrypted USB drive or container can be made using [VeraCrypt](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html).

Also consider using a [paper copy](http://www.jabberwocky.com/software/paperkey/) of the keys as an additional backup measure.

To format and encrypt a USB drive on Linux, first attach it and check its label:

```
$ sudo dmesg | tail
scsi8 : usb-storage 2-1:1.0
usbcore: registered new interface driver usb-storage
scsi 8:0:0:0: USB 0: 0 ANSI: 6
sd 8:0:0:0: Attached scsi generic sg4 type 0

sd 8:0:0:0: [sde] Mode Sense: 43 00 00 00
 sde: sde1
sd 8:0:0:0: [sde] Attached SCSI removable disk
```

Check the size to make sure it's the right drive:

```
$ sudo fdisk -l /dev/sde
Disk /dev/sde: 30 GiB, 32245809152 bytes, 62980096 sectors
/dev/sde1        2048 62980095 62978048  30G  6 FAT16
```

Erase and create a new partition table:

```
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sde

Welcome to fdisk (util-linux 2.25.2).
Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
Be careful before using the write command.

```

Remove and reinsert the USB drive, then create a new partition, selecting defaults:

```
$ sudo fdisk /dev/sde

Keep the backup mounted if you plan on setting up two or more keys as `keytocard` will [delete](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2016-July/056353.html) the local copy on save.

Otherwise, unmount and disconnected the encrypted USB drive:

```
$ sudo umount /mnt

$ sudo cryptsetup luksClose usb
```

# Configure YubiKey

Plug in YubiKey and configure it with the `ykpersonalize` utility:

```
$ sudo ykpersonalize -m82
Firmware version 4.3.7 Touch level 527 Program sequence 1

The USB mode will be set to: 0x82

Commit? (y/n) [n]: y
```

The -m option is the mode command. To see the different modes, enter `ykpersonalize –help`. Mode 82 (in hex) enables the YubiKey NEO as a composite USB device (HID + CCID).  Once you have changed the mode, you need to re-boot the YubiKey – so remove and re-insert it. On YubiKey NEO with firmware version 3.3 or higher, you can enable composite USB device with `-m86` instead of `-m82`.

**Note** YubiKey NEO shipped after November 2015 have [all modes enabled](https://www.yubico.com/support/knowledge-base/categories/articles/yubikey-neo-manager/); so this configuration may be skipped. Older versions of the YubiKey NEO may need to be reconfigured as a composite USB device (HID + CCID) which allows OTPs to be emitted while in use as a SmartCard.

**Windows** Use the [YubiKey NEO Manager](https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/download/yubikey-neo-manager/) to enable CCID functionality.

# Configure Smartcard

Use GPG to configure YubiKey as a smartcard:

```
$ gpg --edit-card
Reader ...........: Yubico Yubikey 4 OTP U2F CCID
Application ID ...: D2760001240102010006055532110000

PIN retry counter : 3 0 3
Signature counter : 0
Signature key ....: [none]

General key info..: [none]
```

## Change PIN

The default PIN codes are `12345678` for the Admin PIN (aka PUK) and `123456` for the PIN. The CCID-mode PINs can be up to 127 ASCII characters long.

The Admin PIN is required for some card operations and to unblock a PIN that has been entered incorrectly more than three times. See the GnuPG documentation on [Managing PINs](https://www.gnupg.org/howtos/card-howto/en/ch03s02.html) for details.

# Transfer keys

Transferring keys to YubiKey using `keytocard` is a one-way operation only, so make sure you've made a backup before proceeding.

Previous GPG versions required the `toggle` command before selecting keys. The currently selected key(s) are indicated with an `*`. When moving keys only one key should be selected at a time.

```
$ gpg --edit-key $KEYID

# Export public key

Mount another USB drive to copy the public key, or save it somewhere where you can easily access later.

```
$ gpg --armor --export $KEYID > /mnt/public-usb-key/pubkey.txt
```

On Windows:

```
$ gpg --armor --export $KEYID -o \path\to\dir\pubkey.gpg
```

Optionally, the public key may be uploaded to a [public keyserver](https://debian-administration.org/article/451/Submitting_your_GPG_key_to_a_keyserver):

```
$ gpg --send-key $KEYID
gpg: sending key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB to hkps server hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
[...]
```

After some time, the public key will to propagate to [other](https://pgp.key-server.io/pks/lookup?search=doc%40duh.to&fingerprint=on&op=vindex) [servers](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?search=doc%40duh.to&op=index).

# Cleanup

Ensure you have:

* Saved the password to the Master key.
* Saved a copy of the Master key, subkeys and revocation certificates on encrypted offline storage.
* Saved the password to that encrypted volume in a separate location.
* Saved a copy of the public key somewhere easily accessible later.
* Moved the Encryption, Signing and Authentication subkeys to YubiKey.

Then reboot or [securely delete](http://srm.sourceforge.net/) `$GNUPGHOME` and remove the secret keys from the GPG keyring:

```
$ sudo srm -r $GNUPGHOME || sudo rm -rf $GNUPGHOME

$ gpg --delete-secret-key $KEYID
```

Make sure you have securely erased keys, including revocation certificates, if a Live image was not used!

# Using keys

You can reboot back into the Live image to test YubiKey.

Install required programs:

```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install -y \
     curl gnupg2 gnupg-agent \
     cryptsetup scdaemon pcscd
```

Create a hardened configuration for GPG with the following options or by downloading my [recommended](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg.conf) version directly:

```
$ mkdir ~/.gnupg ; curl -Lfo ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg.conf

$ cat ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
personal-cipher-preferences AES256 AES192 AES CAST5

list-options show-uid-validity
verify-options show-uid-validity
with-fingerprint
require-cross-certification
use-agent

$ chmod 600 ~/.gnupg/gpg.conf
```

# Import public key

To import the public key from a file on an encrypted USB drive:

```
$ sudo cryptsetup luksOpen /dev/sdd1 usb
Enter passphrase for /dev/sdd1:

$ sudo mount /dev/mapper/usb /mnt

$ gpg --import /mnt/pubkey.txt
gpg: key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB: public key "Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

To download the public key from a keyserver:

```
$ gpg --recv 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB
gpg: requesting key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB from hkps server hkps.pool.sks-keyservers.net
[...]
gpg: key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB: public key "Dr Duh <doc@duh.to>" imported
gpg: Total number processed: 1
gpg:               imported: 1
```

If you get the error `gpgkeys: HTTP fetch error 1: unsupported protocol` - this means you need to install a special version of curl which supports GPG:

```
$ sudo apt-get install -y gnupg-curl
```

## Trust master key

Edit the Master key to assign it ultimate trust by selecting `trust` then option `5`:

```
$ gpg --edit-key 0xFF3E7D88647EBCDB

Secret key is available.

# SSH

[gpg-agent](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/GnuPG#SSH_agent) supports the OpenSSH ssh-agent protocol (`enable-ssh-support`), as well as Putty's Pageant on Windows (`enable-putty-support`). This means it can be used instead of the traditional ssh-agent / pageant. There are some differences from ssh-agent, notably that gpg-agent does not _cache_ keys rather it converts, encrypts and stores them - persistently - as GPG keys and then makes them available to ssh clients. Any existing ssh private keys that you'd like to keep in `gpg-agent` should be deleted after they've been imported to the GPG agent.

When importing the key to `gpg-agent`, you'll be prompted for a passphrase to protect that key within GPG's key store - you may want to use the same passphrase as the original's ssh version. GPG can both cache passphrases for a determined period (ref. `gpg-agent`'s various `cache-ttl` options), and since version 2.1 can store and fetch passphrases via the macOS keychain. Note than when removing the old private key after importing to `gpg-agent`, keep the `.pub` key file around for use in specifying ssh identities (e.g. `ssh -i /path/to/identity.pub`).

Probably the biggest thing missing from `gpg-agent`'s ssh agent support is being able to remove keys. `ssh-add -d/-D` have no effect. Instead, you need to use the `gpg-connect-agent` utility to lookup a key's keygrip, match that with the desired ssh key fingerprint (as an MD5) and then delete that keygrip. The [gnupg-users mailing list](https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-users/2016-August/056499.html) has more information.

## Create configuration

Create a hardened configuration for gpg-agent with the following options or by downloading my [recommended](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/gpg-agent.conf) version directly:

```
$ curl -Lfo ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drduh/config/master/gpg-agent.conf

$ cat ~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf
enable-ssh-support
pinentry-program /usr/bin/pinentry-curses
default-cache-ttl 60
max-cache-ttl 120
```

Alternatively, you may want to use `/usr/bin/pinentry-gnome3` to use a GUI manager. On macOS, use `brew install pinentry-mac` and adjust the program path to suit.

## Replace agents

To launch `gpg-agent` for use by SSH, use the `gpg-connect-agent /bye` or `gpgconf --launch gpg-agent` commands.

Add these to your shell `rc` file:

```
export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=$(gpgconf --list-dirs agent-ssh-socket)
gpgconf --launch gpg-agent
```

On some systems, you may need to use the following instead:

```
export GPG_TTY="$(tty)"
export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/user/$UID/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"
gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye
```

## Copy public key

Copy and paste the output from `ssh-add` to the server's `authorized_keys` file:

```
$ ssh-add -L
ssh-rsa AAAAB4NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAz[...]zreOKM+HwpkHzcy9DQcVG2Nw== cardno:000605553211
```

## (Optional) Save public key for identity file configuration

By default, SSH attempts to use all the identities available via the agent. It's often a good idea to manage exactly which keys SSH will use to connect to a server, for example to separate different roles or [to avoid being fingerprinted by untrusted ssh servers](https://blog.filippo.io/ssh-whoami-filippo-io/). To do this you'll need to use the command line argument `-l [identity_file]` or the `IdentityFile` and `IdentitiesOnly` options in `.ssh/config`.

The argument provided to `IdentityFile` is traditionally the path to the _private_ key file (for example `IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa`). For the Yubikey - indeed, in general for keys stored in an ssh agent - `IdentityFile` should point to the _public_ key file, `ssh` will select the appropriate private key from those available via the ssh agent. To prevent `ssh` from trying all keys in the agent use the `IdentitiesOnly yes` option along with one or more `-i` or `IdentityFile` options for the target host.

To reiterate, with `IdentitiesOnly yes`, `ssh` will not automatically enumerate public keys loaded into `ssh-agent` or `gpg-agent`. This means `publickey` authentication will not proceed unless explicitly named by `ssh -i [identity_file]` or in `.ssh/config` on a per-host basis.

In the case of YubiKey usage, to extract the public key from the ssh agent:

```
$ ssh-add -L | grep "cardno:000605553211" > ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
```

Then you can explicitly associate this Yubikey-stored key for used with a host, `github.com` for example, as follows:

```
$ cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
Host github.com
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_yubikey.pub
EOF
```

## Connect with public key authentication

```
$ ssh git@github.com -vvv
[...]
debug2: key: cardno:000605553211 (0x1234567890),

[...]
```

**Note** To make multiple connections or securely transfer many files, consider using the [ControlMaster](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSSH/Cookbook/Multiplexing) ssh option. Also see [drduh/config/ssh_config](https://github.com/drduh/config/blob/master/ssh_config).

## Touch to authenticate

**Note** This is only possible on the Yubikey 4 line.

By default, YubiKey will perform key operations without requiring a touch from the user. To require a touch for every SSH connection, use the [YubiKey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager/) and Admin PIN:

    ykman openpgp touch aut on

To require a touch for the signing and encrypting keys as well:

    ykman openpgp touch sig on
    ykman openpgp touch enc on

The YubiKey will blink when it's waiting for touch.

## Import SSH keys

If there are existing SSH keys that you wish to make available via `gpg-agent`, you'll need to import them. You should then remove the original private keys. When importing the key, `gpg-agent` uses the key's filename as the key's label; this makes it easier to follow where the key originated from. In this example, we're starting with just the YubiKey's key in place and importing `~/.ssh/id_rsa`:

```
$ ssh-add -l
4096 SHA256:... cardno:00060123456 (RSA)

$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa && rm ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

When invoking `ssh-add`, it will prompt for the ssh key's passphrase if present, then the `pinentry` program will prompt and confirm for a new passphrase to use to encrypt the converted key within the gpg key store.

The migrated key should be listed in `ssh-add -l`:

```
$ ssh-add -l
4096 SHA256:... cardno:00060123456 (RSA)
2048 SHA256:... /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
```

Or to show the keys with MD5 fingerprints, as used by `gpg-connect-agent`'s `KEYINFO` and `DELETE_KEY` commands:

```
$ ssh-add -E md5 -l
4096 MD5:... cardno:00060123456 (RSA)
2048 MD5:... /Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa (RSA)
```

When using the key `pinentry` will be invoked to request the key's passphrase. The passphrase will be cached for up to 10 minutes idle time between uses, to a maximum of 2 hours.

## GitHub

You can use YubiKey to sign GitHub commits and tags. It can also be used for GitHub SSH authentication, allowing you to push, pull, and commit without a password.

Log into GitHub and upload SSH and PGP public keys in Settings.

To sign:

	> git config --global user.signingkey $KEYID

Make sure your user.email option matches the email associated with your PGP identity.

Now, to sign commits or tags simply use the `-S` option. GPG will automatically query your YubiKey and prompt you for your PIN.

To authenticate:

Run the following commands **(only for Windows)**:

	> git config --global core.sshcommand 'plink -agent'

You can then change your repository url to:
`git@github.com:USERNAME/repository`. Any authenticated commands will be authorized by your YubiKey.

**Note** If you encounter the error `gpg: signing failed: No secret key` - run `gpg --card-status` with YubiKey plugged in and try the git command again.

## OpenBSD

Install `pcsc-tools` and enable with `sudo rcctl enable pcscd`, then reboot in order to recognize YubiKey.

## Windows

Begin by exporting the SSH key from GPG:

```
$ gpg --export-ssh-key $USERID
```

Copy this key to a file and keep it for later use. It represents the public SSH key corresponding to the secret key on your YubiKey. You can upload this key to any server you wish to SSH into.

To authenticate SSH sessions via our YubiKey we need to enable Gpg4Win's PuTTY integration. Create a file named `gpg-agent.conf` and place it in the directory `C:\%APPDATA%\gnupg`.
The file should contain the line `enable-putty-support`.

Then, open a terminal and run the following commands:

```
> gpg-connect-agent killagent /bye
> gpg-connect-agent /bye
```

Create a shortcut that points to `gpg-connect-agent /bye` and place it in your startup folder to make sure the agent starts after a system shutdown.

Now you can use PuTTY for public key SSH authentication. When the server asks for public key verification, PuTTY will forward the request to GPG, which will prompt you for your PIN and authorize the login using your YubiKey.

# Troubleshooting

- If you don't understand some option - read `man gpg`.

- If you encounter problems connecting to YubiKey with GPG - try unplugging and re-inserting your YubiKey, and restarting the `gpg-agent` process.

- If you receive the error, `gpg: decryption failed: secret key not available` - you likely need to install GnuPG version 2.x.

- If you receive the error, `Yubikey core error: no yubikey present` - make sure the YubiKey is inserted correctly. It should blink once when plugged in.

- If you still receive the error, `Yubikey core error: no yubikey present` - you likely need to install newer versions of yubikey-personalize as outlined in [Install required software](#install-required-software).

- If you receive the error, `Yubikey core error: write error` - YubiKey is likely locked. Install and run yubikey-personalization-gui to unlock it.

- If you receive the error, `Key does not match the card's capability` - you likely need to use 2048 bit RSA key sizes.

- If you receive the error, `sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation` - you probably have ssh-agent running.  Make sure you replaced ssh-agent with gpg-agent as noted above.

- If you still receive the error, `sign_and_send_pubkey: signing failed: agent refused operation` - On Debian, [try](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=835394) `gpg-connect-agent updatestartuptty /bye`

- If you receive the error, `Error connecting to agent: No such file or directory` from `ssh-add -L`, the UNIX file socket that the agent uses for communication with other processes may not be set up correctly. On Debian, try `export SSH_AUTH_SOCK="/run/user/$UID/gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh"`

- If you receive the error, `Permission denied (publickey)`, increase ssh verbosity with the `-v` flag and ensure the public key from the card is being offered: `Offering public key: RSA SHA256:abcdefg... cardno:00060123456`. If it is, ensure you are connecting as the right user on the target system, rather than as the user on the local system. Otherwise, be sure `IdentitiesOnly` is not [enabled](https://github.com/FiloSottile/whosthere#how-do-i-stop-it) for this host.

- If you totally screw up, you can [reset the card](https://developers.yubico.com/ykneo-openpgp/ResetApplet.html).

# Notes

1. YubiKey has two configurations: one invoked with a short press, and the other with a long press. By default, the short-press mode is configured for HID OTP - a brief touch will emit an OTP string starting with `cccccccc`. If you rarely use the OTP mode, you can swap it to the second configuration via the Yubikey Personalization tool. If you *never* use OTP, you can disable it entirely using the [Yubikey Manager](https://developers.yubico.com/yubikey-manager) application (note, this not the similarly named Yubikey NEO Manager).
1. Programming YubiKey for GPG keys still lets you use its two configurations - [OTP](https://www.yubico.com/faq/what-is-a-one-time-password-otp/) and [static password](https://www.yubico.com/products/services-software/personalization-tools/static-password/) modes, for example.
1. Setting an expiry essentially forces you to manage your subkeys and announces to the rest of the world that you are doing so. Setting an expiry on a primary key is ineffective for protecting the key from loss - whoever has the primary key can simply extend its expiry period. Revocation certificates are [better suited](https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/14718/does-openpgp-key-expiration-add-to-security/79386#79386) for this purpose. It may be appropriate for your use case to set expiry dates on subkeys.
